# Introduction

The Centre for Marine Applied Research (CMAR) measures environmental parameters throughout Nova Scotia’s coastal waters to inform coastal ocean users. The Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture (NSDFA) and CMAR have deployed Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP, current meters) at a variety of locations since 2007. This document presents deployment details with current velocity and direction summary figures at several depths collected for **`r station`**, **`r county`** **County** (Figure `r k`).

This document should be considered as a guide only, as data collection is ongoing. The information may be revised pending ongoing data collection and analyses. For more information on CMAR and current meter deployments, visit the [CMAR website](https://cmar.ca/).

## Data Collection 

CMAR collects current data using ADCPs. An ADCP is a hydroacoustic current meter similar to sonar that measures water current velocities over a range of depths. These current meters measure sound waves scattered back from moving particles in the water column and apply the Doppler effect to estimate speed and direction. Each ADCP is deployed on the seafloor and can measure water speed throughout the entire water column (Figure `r k`). ADCPs transmit ultrasonic “pings” of sound at a specific frequency. The pings are measured as they reflect back from particles in the water column. Sound reflecting from particles moving away from the ADCP have a slightly lower frequency than sound reflected from particles moving toward the instrument.  The difference in frequencies is called a Doppler shift and is used to calculate particle speed and direction, and likewise, water movement.

\newpage
## Data Terminology & Notes

Ensemble Intervals - Measurements recorded to memory in single pings at regular intervals.

Averaging Intervals - Measurements recorded to memory averaged over a set period of time.

Pings/Ensemble - Number of discrete sound pings per ensemble.

Bin Size - Vertical segmentation of sound beams into units of consistent height.

**Notes:**

  - All current data presented in this report are traveling away from the ADCP sensor.
  - All compass headings are relative to True North (a reading of 90 degrees is current travelling from west to east). 
  - Bin altitudes are calculated as distance above the seafloor.
  - Data included in this report have been trimmed of side-lobe interference. 
  - Current speed intervals are lower-inclusive.
